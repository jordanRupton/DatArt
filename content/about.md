As a data scientist, one of my favorite tasks is creating visualizations.  However, it's not something I get to do that often in my day job.  I started this blog as a way to work on one-off data visualization projects.

In the long term, I'd love to create custom, personalized visualizations for friends and family.  Maybe one day someone will look at my work and exclaim, "Dat art!"
